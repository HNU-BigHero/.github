- **Champion**: 2024 RoboCup Middle Size League - Ambition Challenge
    
- **Runner-up**: 2024 RoboCup Middle Size League - Soccer Competition
    
- **Runner-up**: 2023 China Robot Competition & RoboCup China Open
    

## 🤖 About Us

The name **BigHeroX** is borrowed from the movie _Big Hero 6_.

- **"X"**: Represents the unknown and infinite possibilities. It symbolizes that our team members, from BigHero1 to BigHero10000, will always maintain our original intention to be brave heroes facing challenges.
    
- **"Variable"**: As an emerging RoboCup Middle Size League team, we are a powerful "variable" and a dark horse on the global stage.
    
- **"Independent Variable"**: We take control of our own destiny, moving towards becoming world champions step by step!
